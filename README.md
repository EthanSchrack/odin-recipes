First HTML project for The Odin Project online web development course. 


Build a basic recipe website.

The goal here is to use my basic understanding of 
HTML to build a basic website. It is not going to 
look pretty, I'm just practicing some new skills. 

I have been able to implement the what I've learned about basic 
elements in HTML to create a website consisting of different web pages
for different recipes. The pages themselves contain images, links, and 
other HTML elements such as ordered lists, unordered lists, headings, 
paragraphs, emphasis, and strong. 

This project has helped to solidify what I have learned thus far.
