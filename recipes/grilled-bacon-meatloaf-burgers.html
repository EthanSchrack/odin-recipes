        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Whisk egg, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, salt, brown sugar, onion powder, 
            garlic powder, thyme, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl. Add breadcrumbs and 
            chopped cooked bacon. Crumble in the ground beef. Mix with your fingers until 
            bacon and breadcrumbs are distributed evenly.</p></li>
            <li><p>Form mixture into 4 burgers with your wet hands. Cover with plastic wrap and
            refrigerate until chilled thoroughly, about 3 hours.</p></li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li><p>Place burgers on the grate and cook, turing occasionally, until firm and
            cooked to your desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the
            center should read between 145 and 150 degrees F (63 degrees C). Let burgers rest
            for a few minutes before serving.</p></li>
